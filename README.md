# bitcoin_mining
a super simple script that provides you with a sha-256 prefixed with a number of zeros of your choice


run this script from console and type any number, after many calculations it will then give you 
the string that can generate a sha-256 that begins with number of zeros

example :
how many zeros do you need? : 6 
ӏպ³ӈͥɋʢ̲ 


to see if it was true you can check the string "ӏպ³ӈͥɋʢ̲ "
and it will give
000000DB3069958AED6603107E02B91898E93C38E238774772934E9D9D48A2CE

starting with six zeros
this program has a wider range of strings, so instead of english ascii's we have a wider range of 33-1415 ascii characters
